# Bespoke binary phenotypes

At present, Genes & Heatlh provides a currated set of 285 binary phenotypes as detailed in the "Phenotype curation" section.  We are aware that TRE users sometimes which to use bespoke phenotypes based on their own currated codelist(s).  We are currently developing this facility but in the interim, users wishing to identify a list of G&H volunteers matchig their codelist(s) can do so using intermediary files generated by the [BI_PY pipeline](https://github.com/genes-and-health/BI_PY/){target="_blank"}.   

## SNOMED, ICD-10, OPCS data

G&H volunteers matched to specific codes can be found within .arrow files in `/library-red/genesandhealth/phenotypes_curated/version010_2025_04/BI_PY/megadata/`:

* icd_only.arrow (all ICD-10 codes assigned to G&H volunteers)
* opcs_only.arrow (all OPCS4 codes assigned to G&H volunteers)
* snomed_only.arrow (all SNOMED CT codes assigned to G&H volunteers)

## Creating a bespoke binary phenotype volunteer list

Users are advised to load and merge the above .arrow files using python or R.  The resulting list can then be used to match against a user-defined list of codes.

For illustration [bespoke_binary_trait_cohort_compiler.ipynb](bespoke_binary_trait_cohort_compiler.ipynb){target="_blank"} is a Jupyter Python notebook which can create i) a count of pseudo_nhs_numbers associated by a list of codes, ii) a table of code : pseudo_nhs_numbers. 

!!! warning
    The notebook is not currently available.  It should be by the end of the week (SR 2025-12-10)
