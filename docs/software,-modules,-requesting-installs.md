# Software, modules, requesting installs

## Software Available

### Linux command line software

A very comprehensive set of genomics and genetics software is available for running from the Linux Terminal command line.

Some software has very good multithreading e.g. `plink2` or `regenie`. If you run these on the 64 core VM (please test on the cheap 2-core machine first) you can get performance quite close to high performance compute (HPC) for some medium sized applications, and you do not have to learn WDL scripts. Alternatively, true cloud HPC is available using WDL Pipelines (see below).

### Programming languages

There are a number of different languages available on the TRE including Python and R. We also have Bash as a shell program and command language.

#### Python

!!! info
    Python does not have the normal virtual environment setup that you might be used to. It is not possible to install packages using `pip install` as you would on your local machine as the TRE does not have internet access, and therefore cannot connect to the Python Package Index (PyPI), or a specific GitHub repository.
    
    Packages are installed by the Sanger Institute and are available to all users.

##### Jupyter notebooks

Jupyter is available in the Applications menu as graphical user interface and can also be run from the Linux command line, by running jupyter notebook in the terminal.

##### VS Code  
The VS Code editor is available in the Applications menu as graphical user interface. It has limited plugins available as they must be specifically requested and installed by the Sanger Institute. The Jupyter notebook plugin is already installed.

!!! warning
    Any commands or scripts that rely on outside software will not work in the VS Code terminal unless the software is installed in the Linux command line. For example, Github Co-pilot will not work in the VS Code terminal.

#### R

RStudio is available in the Applications menu as a graphical user interface for programmers interested in R language. It can be launched from the command line via `rstudio`.

### Instructions for specific software

#### Integrated Genome Viewer (IGV)

We have installed Integrated Genome Viewer (IGV) to run from the Linux Terminal command line (**not** the web browser version).

!!! tip
    Make sure you are using the right genome `fasta` for your `cram` files, otherwise you will get an 'md5 error' (e.g. the default hg19 will not work with Wellcome Sanger Institute crams).
    
    Example for the 5236 Wellcome Sanger Institute low-depth exomes:

    ```
    /usr/local/bin/IGV\_Linux\_2.12.3/igv.sh \
    --genome /genesandhealth/library-red/genesandhealth/exome\_seq/2019\_11\_\_5236\_GNHonly/crams/hs38DH.fa/genesandhealth/library-red/genesandhealth/exome\_seq/2019\_11\_\_5236\_GNHonly/crams/sc\_autozygELGH6823965.cramb 
    ```

    The default set of (hg19) files for IGV are found here

    ```
    /genesandhealth/library-green/sanger/igv/ 
    ```

#### LibreOffice

LibreOffice provides equivalents for Microsoft Excel, Powerpoint and Word and is available in Applications menu as graphical user interface (not from Linux command line).

#### Git

Git is available from the Linux command line for single user use, and has some _limited_ integration with RStudio and Jupyter Notebooks. However, given the fact that the TRE does not have internet access and everyone is signed in as the same user, Git's usefullness is limited. This may change in the future.

### File browser shortcuts

The file browser for Xfce is called 'Thunar'. Settings and defaults should persist between sessions but ~~do not always~~ don't.

Detailed view: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> \+ <kbd>2</kbd> 
New tab: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> \+ <kbd>T</kbd> (only works if the TRE is in fullscreen mode \- Chrome will create a new tab otherwise)

## How to get new software installed

### Software request

Only admins can install new software. As there is no internet access, this also includes CRAN, github, PyPI etc. To get a new software installed, please raise a help desk request. This is done by emailing [hgi@sanger.ac.uk](mailto:hgi@sanger.ac.uk) to generate a ticket. This will take a few days to a week to complete.

!!! note
    Please note that if you wish to use a package that relies on an external service, such as a database or reference data, you will need to make sure that this data is also available on the TRE. This is because the TRE does not have internet access and cannot connect to external services.

### Developer requests

If you are a developer and want to install custom software, for example, a python package that you have written, you can request this to be installed by the Sanger Institute. It will be available to all users. This may require some additional information to be provided to the Sanger Institute particularly around security and data protection.
