# Getting help

Users and Administrators can get help in a number of ways:

1. Genes & Health Industry Consortium users \- use the Microsoft Teams chat  
2. Genes & Health Internal users \- use the MS Teams chat or email [genesandhealth@qmul.ac.uk](mailto:genesandhealth@qmul.ac.uk)
3. Software issues \- raise a ticket by emailing [hgi@sanger.ac.uk](mailto:hgi@sanger.ac.uk) with your request, rather than using Slack/Teams \- this ensures the request is properly logged and can be tracked.  
4. Documentation \- if you have a question about the documentation, or would like to suggest an improvement, please raise an issue on the documentation by emailing [genesandhealth@qmul.ac.uk](mailto:genesandhealth@qmul.ac.uk).
5. Better still, improve the documentation yourself after reading the ["How to update this documentation"](./how-tos/how-to-update-this-documentation.md) section!
