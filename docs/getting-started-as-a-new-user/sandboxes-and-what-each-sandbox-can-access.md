# Sandboxes and what each sandbox can access

You will likely only have access to one sandbox for your project/institution/company and this is likely to be shared with some other users. However, some users will have access to multiple sandboxes. These can be viewed and switched between in the top right menu.

Only selected sandboxes have access to the WDL high-performance compute pipelines. Currently, we will enable pipelines for sandboxes only if you provide your own Google Cloud Billing Account. In this case, you are responsible for any excess or inadvertent spend.
