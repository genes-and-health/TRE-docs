Non-academic users can register for the training course at [eIntegrity Healthcare e-learning](https://www.eintegrity.org/healthcare-course/statutory-and-mandatory-training/).  
After completing the [NHS Data Security Awareness Level 1](https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/data-security-awareness) training course, all users must attest to the [Genes & Health Code of Conduct](https://e4c14f23.tre-documentation.pages.dev/assets/files/TRE_User_Code_of_Conduct_5.0-4fb0174879dd67ccf5dc610fd014d9c2.pdf) and upload their certificate to Genes & Health new user registration system.

These steps are important for our  [NHS Digital Data Security and Protection Toolkit](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/looking-after-information/data-security-and-information-governance/data-security-and-protection-toolkit), and [ISO 27001](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001) accreditation.  
!!! warning "Caution"  
	Users who have not completed the Data Security Awareness training or attested to the Code of Conduct are subject to having their account deactivated.

## Setting up a profile

When first set up, users will get an email from Google (to their normal email address). This will have a username@genesandhealth.qmul.ac.uk username. You need to Add this as a Profile in Google Chrome. Please do not try to use any other browser than Google Chrome\!  
!!! note
    This username is not an email address, and we will not send email to it. It cannot receive email; it is just a username for the TRE.  Once you have done this, go to Manage Your Account and Security and turn 2 Step Verification on. You will need to enter a phone number and get a code by SMS/text message. You cannot access the TRE without this enabled.
