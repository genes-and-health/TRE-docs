Some people have taken part twice (or more than twice) over the years in Genes &amp; Health, and will have a different Oragene ID each time.</p> <p>Genes &amp; Health uses the Questionnaire data to look up a volunteer's 5236_cram_IDlinkage.xlsx(if not already provided).

A volunteer should only have one single NHS number in NHS systems (we have found a few exceptions to this rule that we have reported to NHS Digital for consideration of merging).</p> <p>A file is provided linking Oragene ID to pseudoNHS number (see below). Note that this linkage sometimes changes slightly e.g. if we find a missing NHS number, for new samples, or if we identify an error in previous NHS number lookup.</p> <p>Recall studies (stage 2) get their own stage 2 ID. We will provide files linking to pseudoNHS number. The primary identifier used for volunteer recall is the NHS number.</p> <p>Wellcome Sanger Institute has used several other ID types e.g. sanger sample ID, cram file ID, EBI-EGA submission ID.
